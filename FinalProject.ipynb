    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The background of our research question originates from each members' inherent interest in the prevalence of Motor Vehicle Accidents (MVA) within the United States as a whole. Considering the fact that MVAs have the potential of damaging not just infrastructure, but also the lives of those involved in said MVAs, it was hard for each of us within this research group to not question why this might occur in the first place. As soon as we identified the fact that this is the research question we would be investigating for our data science project, we immediately started looking for any public information regarding MVAs, but more specifically, MVAs within the city of San Diego. After some deep research, we were able to find said data, and from these sources, we started to build up on our ideas regarding how we would analyze and integrate the data into a presentable form."

    "## Research Question\n",
    "\n",
    "Our research question concerns the following: Are there implicit determinants of MVAs in the city of San Diego? In our project, we look into data regarding weather, infrastructural integrity, and the overall lighting (bright, dark, etc.) in the areas relative to the location of each MVA. "

    "## Significance\n",
    "\n",
    "Our research inherently deals with accidents that directly affect people in a way that is potentially harmful, not just to the infrastrucutre in San Diego, but also to the livelihood of the individuals involved in the accidents themselves. Any time there is a MVA, there is a chance that there is physical harm done, and that said physical harm may haven been partly due to the conditions surrounding the accident itself, such as potholes, poor lighting, etc. The importance we, as a group, see in this project is oriented around the possibility that doing data analysis and showing statistics on MVAs and their corresponding conditions could potentially reveal ways in which the San Diego can better prevent these accidents from occurring. For example, if we happen find a correlation between poor lighting and higher occurences of MVAs, then it may provide the initiative to investigate these areas and even potentially replace said lighting. Or if we happen to find an area of San Diego that has a high rate of MVAs while under the influence, then this could also be used to better gauge where there needs to be patrolling done to identify and prevent these forms of MVAs."

    "## Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "Our prediction as a group is that there will be a strong correlation between poor street conditions and MVAs (i.e. the more worse the street condition, the more MVA's there will be). We came to form this hypothesis as a byproduct of the inherent assumption that accidents are more probable in areas where the conditions at hand are less than optimal in creating an environment that ensures easier transportation. In other words, our hypothesis was formed simply because it seemed more logical to assume that poor conditions are more likely to hold accidents than conditions that do not have such poor conditions. These conditions will be defined by Overall Condition Index (OCI): \n",
    "\n",
    "\"Good\" street conditions are defined as follows: A street in this category has little or no cracking, minor potholes, or other distresses. It has excellent drivability and needs little maintenance or remedial repair. A street in good condition has an OCI rating between 70 and 100. \n",
    "\n",
    "\"Fair\" street conditions are defined as follows: A street in this category has moderate cracking, some minor potholes and has adequate drivability. It is typically in need of remedial repairs and a slurry seal. A street in fair condition has an OCI rating between 40 and 69. \n",
    "\n",
    "\"Poor\" conditions are defined as follows: A street in this category has severe cracking, numerous areas of failed pavement with possible sub base failure, and exhibits a rough ride. It qualifies for a comprehensive repair or a total reconstruction – meaning that a street may be replaced from the ground up if conditions warrant that effort. A street in poor condition has an OCI rating between 0 and 39. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is also the possibility that MVAs within San Diego have implications regarding a variety of different characteristics of the city itself. There may also be additional problems besides infrastructure, such as the nature of obtaining drivers licenses, or maybe even the physical or mental state in which drivers are operating the vehicles themselves."

    "## Potential Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many potential answers to the variety of different problems inherent within our research question. If our project renders our hypothesis valid, than a possible solution would be to have the city of San Diego distribute more money to improving the conditions of road infrastructure. If our hypothesis ends up lacking support, then are possible solutions could be highly variable. For example, if there ends up being a correlation between weather and MVAs, then a possible solution may orient around the city of San Diego promoting driving and safety techniques to cope with said weather. If there is a correlation between lighting and MVAs, then a possible solution may deal with funds towards things like better street lights, or less prevalence of fluorescent lighting if brightness ends up being correlated to MVAs. These potential solutions will be explored further towards the end of the study once there has been actual data analysis. "

    "## Potential Confounds\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a variety of potential confounds in regards to our data project. When it comes to determining why accidents occur within San Diego, or even as a whole, we as a group could potentially be dealing with a lot more than just variables regarding weather, OCI, and lighting. In fact, we could be dealing with the mentality inherent in American culture. For example, a variable that could affect the level of car crashes in San Diego could be oriented around the fact that Americans are inherently more attracted to the idea of owning and operating their own vehicles, in comparison to European culture, which is more heavily reliant on public transportation. Another potential, and similar, confound could deal with the actual skill of those driving. There is not necessarily any data quantifying the level of driving skill in each of these MVAs, but that is something that could be a direct cause of many MVAs in contrast to variables such as lighting, weather, and OCI. Regardless, the variables mentioned above would be extremely hard to do actual data analysis on, considering the fact that there really is not any kind of relevant data oriented around these two topics, despite the fact that they could be potentially influencing our research question."

    "\n",
    "If our hypothesis, which is that there will be a strong correlation between poor street conditions and MVAs, ends up being incorrect, then we as a group will investigate further into the nature of the incidents themselves. Rather than look into the infrastructure as a possible influence in MVAs in San Diego, such as the lighting and the weather. If these additional variables prove to be insignificant in regards to MVAs, we will end up investigating other factors in which these MVAs occurred, such as whether or not those involved in the MVAs were in any way under the infleunce while operating their respective vehicles."

    "## Methods and Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "In regards to where we received our data, there were two individual sources that we used. For our MVA, lighting, and weather data, we used the California Highway Patrol Homepage, linked here: http://iswitrs.chp.ca.gov/Reports/jsp/RawData.jsp\n",
    "\n",
    "As for our OCI data, we used the Streets Overall Condition Index page on sandiego.gov, as linked here: https://data.sandiego.gov/datasets/streets-overall-condition-index/\n",
    "\n",
    "The methods by which we conducted our cleaning and analysis will be detailed in the study below. However, as a brief summarization, this is what was done in regards to the cleaning process of our datasets:\n",
    "1. The main dataset that needed cleaning was our main MVA set, which required us to remove highways, state roads, and interstates that were not represented by the OCI dataset. In addition to this, we also cleared any data involving drugs or alcohol, simply because it would interfere with our analysis of infrastructural influence of MVAs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a brief summarization of what was done in regards to data analytics:\n",
    "1. Each OCI value was given a particular color code, and was then graphed into a barh plot relative to the number of MVAs corresponding to 'Poor,' 'Fair,' and 'Good,' OCI values. It is our intention to measure the signficance of this visualization using a ttest or chi-square, however, we are still in the process of making that happen. Despite this, we were able to employ chi-square statistics in regards to statistical significance between OCI, weather, and lighting, and MVAs, weather and lighting. After an additional barh plot was displayed to show the prevalence of MVAs relative to weather and lighting conditions. A chi-square statistic was then found for each of these variables (OCI, weather and lighting, and MVAs, weather, and lighting). Following this statistical analysis and data visualization, one last graph, a bar graph, was displayed to show the prevalence of of accidents and their corresponding causes (i.e. unsafe speeding, wrong side of the wrong, etc.) More info on what will be done from during this week before presentation and project submission will be detailed in the discussion at the very end of the project.

    "We first try to find evidence of any correlation between road conditions and possible motor vehicle accidents. In our hypothesis, we argued that there should be a strong correlation from the get go. To visualize this, we plotted the frequency of accidents that occured in each of the category description of OCI. \n",

    "There is immediately a huge disparity in the frequency of MVAs when comparing the OCI Descriptions. We see that the amount of fair road accidents eclipse both good and fair accidents. This means that a huge proportion of accidents in our dataset must have occurred on \"fair\" quality roads. "

    "On the above chart, we see the majority of the \"techinical\" accidents [08 -> 04] be more right skewed whereas the more environmentally operation accidents (EOA) [11 -> 02] seem to occur less frequently. With the information from the collision violation vs frequency of collision graph and the chi squared test, we can start to infer the EOA type accidents would seem to rely on the lighting of the situation whereas the techinical accidents don't. The results of our study seem to indicate that though accidents could be caused by the infrastructure (lighting), the majority of accidents happen outside of these variables. "

    "## Discussion \n",
    "\n",
    "From our data so far, we can say based on the chi-square statistical analysis that there is likely very little correlation between OCI, weather, and lighting (p-value=0.968620556964), we can assume that there may be a connection between MVAs, lighting, and weather (p-value=0.00480520182373). However, in order to truly provide evidence against our initial hypothesis, we need to conduct statistical analysis of the relationship between OCI and MVAs. This is a fundamental constituent of our study that we unfortunately have to spend more time on during the week before presentation and project submission, simply due to the fact that this project is very much a learning experience for every single one of us in the group. In addition to this, statistical analyis should, and will be done on types of accidents, and their relations to weather, lighting, and OCI. In regards to a solution, it would be far-stretched to assume that any 'solution' given at this time adequately represents the end solution to our project. The truth of the matter is that we have technically not provided enough evidence to uphold the null hypothesis (which states that our initial hypothesis is wrong), and because of this, we can not provide a solid solution to anything. The only inkling of correlation that occurs in our study is between MVAs, lighting, and weather. Any solution in this regard would be oriented around distributed a greater amount of funds to more appropriate lighting, or even perhaps funding towards providing the city of San Diego with better information on how to cope with weather while operating vehicles and employ safer techniques while driving. But again, to suggest that this an actual solution at this time would be shortsighted and a complete disregard to the further work that needs to be done for our project. While the analysis has been difficult in areas, there is some good indication that we find, not just influences of MVAs, but influences that can be addressed by the city of San Diego itself--Especially if our statistical analyis follows the trend of highlighting correlations between MVAs, lighting, and weather like it has been. In the interim, though, our group will seek the help of our TAs and professor in regards to running statistical analysis of OCI relative to MVAs. Once this is completed, we will be able to confidently move towards our alternative hypothesis, or even search for other influences that coincide more with our null hypothesis (such as weather and lighting).
